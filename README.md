# Mirror of GoD-Tony's updater plugin
---

## Why is this here?
Bitbucket has discontinued support for Mercurial repositories, making the [original repository](https://bitbucket.org/GoD_Tony/updater/) and its contents unavailable.
(We currently support this updater plugin in SourceBans++ and need a reliable way to fetch the updater.inc include to fully compile SourceBans++.
